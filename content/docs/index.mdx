## Why ReactUseKit?

**Most hook libraries require installation.** We're different. Get exactly what you need without the bloat.

**Two simple ways to use:**

- Install via shadcn CLI integration
- Copy-paste directly into your project

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Zero dependencies** - No bundle bloat
- ✅ **TypeScript-first** - Full type safety
- ✅ **Your code** - Customize however you want
- ✅ **Production-ready** - Battle-tested implementations

Instead of adding another dependency, you own the code completely. No version conflicts, no breaking changes, no vendor lock-in.
